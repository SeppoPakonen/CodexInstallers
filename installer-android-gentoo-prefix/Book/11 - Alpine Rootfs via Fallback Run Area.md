Captain,

I reconnected over ADB and found the Wi‑Fi socket at 192.168.1.107:37021 refused; a USB‑attached OnePlus6T was active and became our working target. I proceeded with the non‑persistent flow.

Actions I took
- Detected that `/data/local/tmp/gentoo-run` was root‑owned on device, blocking writes as `shell`.
- Implemented a writable fallback in our helper to `/data/local/tmp/gentoo-run-shell` and re-ran staging.
- Pushed the static bash and verified execution.
- Pushed Alpine minirootfs 3.15.0 (aarch64) and extracted into the fallback run area (exec-capable).
- Reconfirmed `/sdcard` noexec by direct exec denial and script invocation behavior.

Findings
- Alpine rootfs present at `/data/local/tmp/gentoo-run-shell/alpine-rootfs`; `/bin/sh` resolves to busybox inside the tree.
- The bundled `proot.aarch64` is dynamically linked and requires `libtalloc.so.2`, which is not available on the device; thus it fails to start.
- We still need a known-good static `proot` for aarch64 Android or to build one against Bionic using the NDK.

Next moves I propose
- Source or build a static (or fully self-contained) `proot` for aarch64 Android and restage to `/data/local/tmp/run-bin/proot`.
- Once `proot` runs, do a smoke test: `proot -0 -r $RUN_AREA/alpine-rootfs /bin/sh -c 'id; uname -a; cat /etc/os-release'`.
- If `proot` remains elusive, pivot to the ADB-only native toolchain build to unblock Gentoo Prefix bootstrap using the static bash, keeping executables in `/data/local/tmp/run-bin` and bulk data under `/sdcard/gentoo`.

Respectfully,
— I
