Captain,

The Alpine `apk` database lock has been cleared and the base toolchain is installed inside the rooted chroot.

Actions
- Removed `/lib/apk/db/lock` and refreshed `apk-tools`.
- Ensured DNS resolver present; updated indexes.
- Installed base set: `bash curl git tar xz coreutils findutils grep sed gawk patch make gcc g++ musl-dev python3`.

Result
- Alpine chroot fully provisioned for running Gentoo Prefix bootstrap.

Next
- Run Prefix bootstrap with `EPREFIX=/data/local/tmp/gentoo` and `DISTDIR=/sdcard/gentoo/distfiles`.
