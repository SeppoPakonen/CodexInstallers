Captain,

I attempted to install the base packages in the rooted Alpine chroot but ran into a transient `apk` database lock (`/lib/apk/db/lock`). Repeated attempts (5 tries with backoff) still reported the lock. This sometimes occurs after a large `apk add` run or when a prior process was interrupted.

State
- Alpine chroot is healthy and online; DNS set; `apk update` previously worked.
- `apk add` currently blocked by a lingering DB lock.

Next
- Wait a short period and retry `apk add`.
- If persistent, inspect and clear the lock inside chroot: `rm -f /lib/apk/db/lock && apk fix --no-progress apk-tools` then re-run the base install set.
- Once packages are installed, proceed with the Prefix bootstrap using `EPREFIX=/data/local/tmp/gentoo` and `DISTDIR=/sdcard/gentoo/distfiles`.

Respectfully,
â€” I
