# Installation Status - Compaq Mini 900

## Current Status
- **Date**: October 14, 2025
- **Phase**: Initial setup and preparation
- **Progress**: Documentation and environment setup

## Installation Timeline
### October 14, 2025
- Created basic directory structure
- Created initial documentation files (AGENTS.md, README.md, HARDWARE.md, KERNEL.md, BOOT.md)
- Prepared for SSH connection to 192.168.1.129
- Successfully connected via SSH and gathered actual hardware information
- Updated documentation with actual hardware specifications
- Created installation scripts for dual-storage configuration

## Current Status
The Gentoo installation on the Compaq Mini 900 is currently **WAITING FOR KERNEL TO BUILD**. The kernel compilation process is ongoing and taking much longer than expected due to the hardware constraints of the Intel Atom N270 processor with limited RAM.

## Planned Steps
1. **[DONE]** Establish SSH connection to target device
2. **[DONE]** Verify hardware specifications on actual device
3. **[DONE]** Confirm disk layout and storage configuration
4. **[DONE]** Execute complete installation setup - partition storage
5. **[DONE]** Download and extract stage3 tarball to /mnt/gentoo
6. **[IN PROGRESS]** Perform chroot installation 
   - [x] Set up chroot environment with necessary mounts
   - [x] Configure basic system settings (time, locale, hostname)
   - [x] Update make.conf with Atom N270 optimizations
   - [x] Install kernel sources (gentoo-sources-6.12.41)
   - [x] Configure kernel for Compaq Mini 900 hardware
   - [x] Update kernel config with hardware-specific options based on lspci/lsusb results
   - [IN PROGRESS] Kernel compilation ongoing (taking very long due to Atom N270) - **CURRENTLY WAITING**
   - [PENDING] Install and configure bootloader (GRUB)
   - [PENDING] Complete dual-storage bind mount setup
7. **[PENDING]** Install bootloader (GRUB)
8. **[PENDING]** Perform post-installation dual-storage configuration with bind mounts

## Completed Steps
- [x] Create project structure
- [x] Document hardware specifications (updated with actual data)
- [x] Prepare installation documentation
- [x] Set up session best practices documentation
- [x] Connect via SSH and gather actual hardware information
- [x] Identify storage configuration (sda: 16GB SSD, sdc: 128GB SD Card)
- [x] Create scripts for dual-storage setup
- [x] Partition sda with 512MB boot, 3GB swap, remaining for root
- [x] Format sda partitions (vfat for boot, swap, ext4 for root)
- [x] Partition sdc with single ext4 partition for storage
- [x] Format sdc1 as ext4
- [x] Mount filesystems to /mnt/gentoo
- [x] Create fstab with UUIDs for stable mounting
- [x] Create storage directories on SD card for dual-storage setup
- [x] Extract stage3 tarball to target system
- [x] Configure make.conf with optimizations for Atom N270 and limited RAM
- [x] Set up chroot environment with necessary filesystem mounts
- [x] Perform initial system configuration (time, locale, hostname, network)
- [x] Install kernel sources (gentoo-sources-6.12.41)
- [x] Configure kernel for Compaq Mini 900 hardware (Intel 945GSE graphics)
- [x] Update kernel configuration with specific hardware support for:
  - Intel Mobile 945GSE Express Integrated Graphics Controller
  - Broadcom BCM4312 802.11b/g LP-PHY wireless controller
  - Marvell 88E8040 PCI-E Fast Ethernet controller
  - Intel ICH7 Family High Definition Audio Controller
- [x] Install kernel installation tools and firmware

## Key Findings
- **Hardware Constraints**: The installation is significantly slowed by the Intel Atom N270 (1.6GHz, 32-bit) with only 1.9GB RAM
- **Compilation Time**: Kernel compilation is taking several hours (expected for this hardware)
- **Network Hardware**: Broadcom wireless and Marvell ethernet controllers are supported
- **Graphics**: Intel 945GSE graphics require specific kernel options (CONFIG_DRM_I915, CONFIG_FB_INTEL)
- **Storage**: Dual-storage setup with SSD for frequently accessed files and SD card for storage is configured in fstab

## Current State
- System is running in chroot environment
- Kernel compilation still in progress in background (make vmlinuz -j2)
- Root filesystem is prepared on 16GB SSD
- Extended storage configured on 128GB SD card
- Hardware-specific kernel configuration completed
- make.conf optimized with MAKEOPTS=\"-j2 -l1.5\" and limited USE flags

## Blocking Issues
None at this time.

## Current Storage Configuration
- **sda**: SanDisk pSSD 16G, 15.27 GiB, partitioned as:
  - sda1: 512MB vfat partition (boot), UUID=E9E8-0F8E
  - sda2: 3GB swap partition, UUID=49469354-e8af-402c-aac7-0e6275a88130
  - sda3: ~12.5GB ext4 root partition, UUID=d548b245-9961-4146-98e4-f24d0a7adf35
- **sdc**: Flash Reader, 115.94 GiB, partitioned as:
  - sdc1: ~115GB ext4 partition for extended storage, UUID=ed87b138-e32e-487c-a48d-fcdb00a6b7db
- **sdb**: TS1GJF150, 980 MiB - Current boot medium (Gentoo live USB)

## Dual-Storage Configuration
- Root filesystem installed on SSD for performance
- Extended storage directories on SD Card:
  - /mnt/sdcard/home - User home directories
  - /mnt/sdcard/usr/portage - Portage tree
  - /mnt/sdcard/var/cache/distfiles - Distfiles cache
  - /mnt/sdcard/var/tmp - Persistent temporary files

## Notes for Next Steps
- Verify SSH connectivity to 192.168.1.129
- Confirm the target disk device path before any partitioning operations
- Use tmux and logging as per repository conventions
- Follow destructive operation checklist before disk operations
