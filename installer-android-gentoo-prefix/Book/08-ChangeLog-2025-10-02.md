I set up the session on a OnePlus 9 Pro over ADB Wi‑Fi. I created `/sdcard/gentoo` for bulk data and `/data/local/tmp/run-bin` for executables. I verified `/sdcard` is noexec and that symlinks are blocked.

I pushed a static bash and prepared optional Alpine. I wrote `adb-setup.sh` to automate device prep and `push-run-bin.sh` to sync host‑built tools. I built binutils 2.42 for Android via NDK r26b and verified `/data/local/tmp/run-bin/bin/ld -v` on the device.

I began GCC 13.2.0 stage1. When I hit header issues, I corrected the environment to avoid leaking the NDK sysroot into host CFLAGS and restricted Android specifics to `*_FOR_TARGET`. I documented the rooted chroot alternative and SELinux adjustments, but kept the main path ADB‑only.

Next, I will let GCC stage1 finish, push the results, and run the Gentoo Prefix bootstrap with `EPREFIX=/data/local/tmp/gprefix` and `DISTDIR=/sdcard/gentoo/distfiles`.
