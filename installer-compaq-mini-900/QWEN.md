# Compaq Mini 900 Installer QWEN.md

## Project Overview
This directory contains the remote installer project for installing Gentoo Linux (x86) on the Compaq Mini 900 laptop. This project follows the patterns established in the broader CodexInstallers repository, focusing on remote, SSH-driven installations with an emphasis on safety, idempotence, and resilience.

The Compaq Mini 900 is a legacy netbook that requires special attention for a successful Gentoo installation due to its older hardware specifications and potential BIOS limitations.

## Current Status
- **Hardware**: Compaq Mini 900 (x86)
- **Installation Method**: Remote SSH from 192.168.1.129
- **Target OS**: Gentoo Linux (x86)
- **Status**: Initial setup - installation in progress

## Hardware Specifications (Estimated)
Based on typical Compaq Mini 900 specifications:
- Processor: Intel Atom (likely N270, 1.6GHz, 32-bit capable)
- RAM: 1-2GB (expandable)
- Storage: 160GB HDD (may be smaller)
- Graphics: Intel GMA 950 integrated
- Network: Ethernet + possible built-in WiFi
- Form factor: 10.2" netbook with keyboard

## Remote Installation Process
1. SSH to target device: `ssh root@192.168.1.129`
2. Start tmux session for resilience: `tmux new -s gentoo_install`
3. Enable logging: `script -aq /root/install.log`
4. Verify hardware: `lsblk -d -o NAME,MODEL,SIZE,ROTA,TYPE` and `lspci`
5. Follow Gentoo installation handbook adapted for Compaq Mini 900

## Building and Running
To initiate the installation process:

1. Ensure you have SSH access to the target device
2. Navigate to this directory
3. Follow the AGENTS.md guidelines for session setup:
   ```bash
   ssh root@192.168.1.129
   tmux new -s gentoo_install
   script -aq /root/install.log
   set -euo pipefail
   umask 022
   ```
4. Execute installation scripts in the `scripts/` directory when they're created

## Key Files and Directories
- `AGENTS.md` - Device-specific installation notes and procedures
- `scripts/` - Installation scripts (to be created)
- `README.md` - High-level overview of the installation process
- `HARDWARE.md` - Detailed hardware specifications and quirks
- `KERNEL.md` - Kernel configuration notes for Compaq Mini 900
- `BOOT.md` - Bootloader configuration (likely GRUB for legacy BIOS)
- `STATUS.md` - Current installation status
- `NOTES.md` - Miscellaneous notes and troubleshooting
- `AFTER_INSTALLATION.md` - Post-installation configuration

## Development Conventions
Following the CodexInstallers conventions:
- Shell scripts should use `set -euo pipefail` for error handling
- All destructive operations require explicit confirmation
- Use UUIDs in `/etc/fstab` for stability
- Keep sessions resilient with tmux and logging
- Document changes and decisions in Markdown files
- Keep small, frequent updates to maintain documentation accuracy

## Safety Practices
- Always confirm target disk device before partitioning/formatting
- Verify hardware details with `lsblk`, `blkid`, and `lspci`
- Use `parted` or `fdisk` carefully with explicit device confirmation
- Test bootloader configuration before finalizing installation
- Maintain logs of all operations for troubleshooting

## Known Challenges for Compaq Mini 900
- Limited RAM (may require careful stage3 selection and compilation flags)
- Older hardware may need specific kernel options
- Potential UEFI vs BIOS considerations
- Limited disk space may require careful partition planning
- Older WiFi cards may need specific drivers

## Installation Approach
- Direct SSH commands will be used for the installation process
- Scripts will only be used if direct command execution encounters issues
- All destructive operations will require explicit confirmation

## Current Status: WAITING FOR KERNEL TO BUILD
The installation is currently waiting for the kernel compilation to complete on the Compaq Mini 900 target hardware. The Intel Atom N270 with 1.9GB RAM is taking significantly longer than expected to compile the kernel.

## Key Findings from Installation Process
- **Hardware Constraints**: The 32-bit Intel Atom N270 CPU with limited RAM makes compilation extremely slow
- **Storage Configuration**: Successfully set up dual-storage system with:
  - 16GB SSD (sda) for OS and frequently accessed files
  - 128GB SD Card (sdc) for extended storage (home, portage, distfiles, tmp)
- **Hardware Support**: Identified and configured support for:
  - Intel Mobile 945GSE graphics controller
  - Broadcom BCM4312 wireless controller
  - Marvell 88E8040 Ethernet controller
- **Optimizations Applied**: 
  - MAKEOPTS="-j2 -l1.5" to limit memory usage during compilation
  - Limited USE flags to reduce compilation requirements
  - Appropriate kernel options for all identified hardware components

## Next Steps
The installation is currently in a wait state until the kernel compilation completes, which will take several more hours on this hardware. The system is properly configured and optimized for the limited resources of the Compaq Mini 900.

## Installation Strategy
1. Initial hardware verification
2. Disk partitioning with BIOS boot compatibility
3. Stage 3 installation optimized for x86 Atom
4. Kernel compilation with appropriate drivers for Mini 900
5. System configuration with lightweight desktop environment
6. Bootloader installation (likely GRUB legacy)
7. Post-installation optimization for netbook hardware
